**Executive Summary**
**Project Overview**

The WebLoan QA Process Framework demonstrates an end-to-end Enterprise Quality Assurance operating model for a Financial Loan Management System (LMS), spanning both Agile and Waterfall SDLC methodologies.

This project simulates enterprise-level QA delivery by integrating Manual Testing, API Testing, and UI Automation within a structured SDLC and STLC framework.

The objective is to showcase how quality governance, traceability, risk management, and automation strategy align to ensure production-ready releases in a financial domain application.

**Business Context**

WebLoan is a Loan Management System that enables financial institutions to:

- Manage users with role-based access control (Branch Admin, Loan Manager, Loan Officer)

- Create and manage customer records

- Process and calculate loans

- Generate prequalification letters

- Track loan lifecycle events

Given the financial sensitivity of loan processing systems, the application requires high accuracy, strict validation controls, and controlled user access.

**QA Vision**

The QA approach for this project is designed to:

- Ensure requirement traceability across all layers

- Validate business-critical workflows

- Mitigate financial and security risks

- Integrate Manual, API, and Automation testing layers

- Support Agile sprint-based delivery

- Establish measurable quality gates before release

**Testing Strategy Overview**

The framework includes:

- Functional and negative testing

- Boundary value and equivalence analysis

- Role-based access validation

- API endpoint validation and response verification

- UI automation of high-risk regression flows

- Defect lifecycle governance

- Risk identification and mitigation

**Agile Delivery Model**

Testing activities are structured into iterative sprints aligned with feature development:

Sprint 1 – Authentication & RBAC

Sprint 2 – User Management

Sprint 3 – Customer Management

Sprint 4 – Loan Processing & Calculations

Sprint 5 – Prequalification Workflow

Sprint 6 – Regression Hardening & Automation Expansion

Each sprint includes user stories, acceptance criteria, test case design, execution tracking, defect logging, and retrospective documentation.

**Outcome**

This repository represents a structured, scalable, and enterprise-ready QA operating model designed to demonstrate:

- SDLC and STLC maturity

- Cross-layer testing expertise

- Agile process alignment

- Risk-driven quality validation

- Automation integration strategy
